ConSea
======
ConSea lets you search and find public constants that are defined in ABAP classes and interfaces and use them in your coding. ConSea features:
* regular expression to search for constants
* use of shared objects to speed up the inital loading of constants
* search view plug-in for Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools
 
Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/TheRealTier/ConSea/wiki) for more information.

###Hints
The ABAP part is distributed as a SAPLink nugget called "NUGG_ZCONSEA.nugg" which intstalls three packages and a bunch of development objects. If you want to go with the classical SAPGUI way, just install the objects from this nugget. To start ConSea, use Transaction ZCONSEA and have a try.

The Eclipse plugin part is available in the bin folder. Just copy it into the dropin folder of your eclipse installation.
